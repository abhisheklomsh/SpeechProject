# Speech Project
Task: Classification problem where one has to classify audio files based on presence of sound of Capuchin bird and ignore other birds/animals in the forest. We got promising results using Deep Learning but we drilled further to use classical ML which would prove to be very handy in case of low cost device deployment.


The submission consists of two files, 
- Data Pre Processing and State of the Art Prediction using Deep Learning
- Post processing Modelling using Classical ML
